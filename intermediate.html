    <h1>The Intermediate Text Problem</h1>

    <p>"What do I read after finishing an introductory Latin text like <em>Familia Rōmāna</em>? Virgil seems a little too hard..."
      This is the <em>intermediate text problem</em>: the available Latin texts seem to jump from introductory straight to difficult. My answer to this problem is a series of Latin readers, mainly featuring medieval histories.</p>

    <p>Medieval histories tend to use simpler vocab and use a sentence structure more similar to modern romance languages than classical Latin. Their pacing is often brisk and the topics interesting. Medieval histories can also be used to teach history, helping to integrate Latin into the rest of the curriculum and justify allocating additional time to reading Latin.</p>

    However, there are some obstacles encountered with these texts. I created my readers to solve them.

      <tr><td>It can be difficult to pick a book that's at ones level. Additionally, sometimes medieval writers use rare words, use words in a rare sense, or make up words.</td><td>A fully-parsed glossary is provided for each page, allowing for precise glosses.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Sometimes texts say very unexpected or surprising things, and thus it can be hard to tell if the one's translation is correct.</td><td>Footnotes translations are provided for difficult or surprising passages.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Often these texts are out-of-print and scanned copies are hard-to-read, lack macrons, and engage in non-standard orthography.</td><td>These reader's editions have macronized, hand-checked text using classical spellings and standard orthography.</td></tr>
